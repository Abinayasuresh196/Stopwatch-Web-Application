    <h1>ℹ️ About This App</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Stopwatch Web App</strong> is a fully responsive, multi-page web application designed to help users measure time intervals with precision and ease. Inspired by the stopwatch feature found on mobile phones, this app offers a modern and user-friendly interface right in your browser.</p>
    
    <p>Built using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, the app includes features like:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li>⏱ Start, Pause, Reset, and Lap functions</li>
      <li>📜 Lap history saved using browser's local storage</li>
      <li>📱 Mobile-friendly design with animations and styling</li>
      <li>🌐 Works offline — no installation required</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This project was created by <strong>Pon Abinaya</strong>, a B.Tech Information Technology student at <strong>Francis Xavier Engineering College (FXEC), Tirunelveli</strong>, as part of a practical learning initiative to build professional-grade web applications.</p>

    <p>Version: <strong>1.0.0</strong> | Developed in June 2025</p>
